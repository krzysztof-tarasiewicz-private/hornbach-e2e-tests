 This Cucumber Playwright project is a playground for all who want to explore Acceptance Test with Cucumber (for BDD) and Playwright (for Test Automation).

 Pre-requisits: 
 Have an actual version of Node.js installed. 

 Inside that directory, you can run several commands:
 Open the terminal e.g. in Visaul Studio Code (Tab Terminal -> New) 

 You can run tests with:
 npm test

 Try it out - you have an example test already living inside this project.

What are you testing?
 The demo side, this project is testing, is a free online website: www.saucelab.com - this is built for testing purposes and not the best piece of code, BUT it is free and available and you can use it to learn and explore basic functions. 

 How?
 First, create you own git branch to not whistle-blow the possible automation and testing solutions. 

 Second, checkout your branch and start to write a first scenario. You do this in the test/features folder. You can add the test in the existing example.feature

 If you have written a proper test, following BDD rules, run the tests (npm test). In the terminal you will see, that there are new steps that have not been defined, yet. So, copy the suggestion and paste it into the examples.steps.ts file in the test/steps folder. 

 Now you can try to write the typescript code to get the test run. Start with the first step and its implementation and only if it works, move to the next one. 

 
Happy testing! ðŸŽ­
